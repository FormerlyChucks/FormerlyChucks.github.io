          <p>Yet Abraham marries his father's daughter and remains God's favorite:</p>
          <blockquote>
            "And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."<br>
